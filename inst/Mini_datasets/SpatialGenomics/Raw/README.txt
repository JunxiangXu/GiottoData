## Spatial Genomics Mini Kidney Object ####

Raw data for the SG Mini Kidney Object is too large for this repo and can be found at:
https://github.com/drieslab/spatial-datasets/data/2023_spatial_genomics_mouse_kidney/Raw.zip

This folder contains three files: DAPI (cell nuclei coordinates), mask (cell segmentations), and transcripts (coordinates of transcripts and cell number).

The directory to which you save this zip file to can be used to create a Giotto object using the provided script.
